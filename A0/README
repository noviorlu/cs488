## Compilation

To compile and run the program, use the following commands:

```sh
premake4 gmake && make && ./A0
```

This will compile the program using `premake4` and `make`, and then run the resulting OpenGL program. Ensure you are in the root directory of the project when running these commands.

### Lab Computer

The assignment was completed on the MC3007 lab computer. If you encounter any issues running the program, please try it on in-lab computer as a failsafe.

### Additional Features and Assumptions

- **Quit Application**: The Quit button is moved to the top of the Shape Properties palette. You can also quit the program using the `Q` key.
- **Color Control**: Added two new sliders for Green and Blue channels to control the RGB color of the triangle. Together with the existing Red slider, you can fully control the triangle's color.
- **Rotation Control**: Added a slider to control the rotation angle of the triangle. This slider allows rotation through a full 360 degrees.
- **Scaling**: Added keyboard shortcuts to scale the triangle. Use the `-` (minus) key to scale down and the `+` (plus) key to scale up by a constant factor.
- **Reset Button**: Added a Reset button between the Quit button and the sliders. This button resets the triangle to its original state (color, scale, rotation, position). The `R` key also serves as a shortcut for this action.
